        Corporate catering depends on the size and level of the function being hosted. Corporate functions may range from small gatherings to fancy dinners. These require a specific type of structure when catering for them. Some companies would prefer a small open bar for its residents while others will opt for a small foods tasting session.

Corporate functions are elegant and very relaxed and should be catered for with regard to this fact. Hiring a wedding caterer for your corporate function might prove wasteful and will eventually reflect on your expenses.
