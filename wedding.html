        Wedding catering is one of the most common forms 
        of large-scale catering. One of the most critical 
        aspects of a wedding is the reception, which mainly focuses 
        on the food offered to guests. Weddings can be tricky since 
        you may never be able to accurately estimate 
        the number of people to be present during the wedding.
        The menu should reflect the diversity of the invited guests
        with a view to catering to different tastes.
        Aside from the food and the wine, 
        the caterer is also in charge of 
        table settings and displays, which vary for different functions.
        When sourcing for a caterer, get one with experience in wedding catering.
