        Retirement parties, birthdays, baby and bridal showers always call for celebration. These functions are more intimate and demand attention to detail, especially when it comes to catering. Due to their small nature, always make an effort to service clients’ specific dietary needs. Attention to people’s allergens should be noted to avoid cases of inflamed allergies arising from food intake.

Also, cultural beliefs should be considered to avoid the chance of providing prohibited foods during such gatherings. Additional options, aside from the food, such as the theme colour of the event, should also be factored. Compared to weddings and other large gatherings, small social events do not require a large presence of on-site staff. This is done to emphasize the intimate nature of such gatherings.
