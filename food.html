        This is a highly popular catering option for small outdoor functions or functions with many food vendors. They do not require a large staff. Two or four are enough to facilitate the preparation of food and serve people, which is mainly done through a window. Food selection can range from the very simple to fancy depending on a customerâ€™s needs and the nature of the event. This type of catering works well for casual outdoor events in a garden setting where the crowd is not too big as to overwhelm the caterers.
