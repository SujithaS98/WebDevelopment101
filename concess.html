        Public events, major sporting events, and large music concerts fall into this category. Wherever you find large crowds of people gathered, chances are there is food on site. In such cases, only provide the most popular foods since it is difficult to cater to everyoneâ€™s specific dietary needs. For instance, it makes sense to have popular fast food bars instead of full course food options.

Since most of the caterers at these events work as vendors, their goal is to make the most out of an event, which means providing the most popular and unique foods to attract as many customers as possible to their stalls. While planning for such events can be a nightmare, with the right menu choices, you can make a fortune while at the same time ensuring everyone is happy and well fed.
